## About

As a developer-to-be and with basic knowledge of Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript, I decided to go on a 2-month journey this summer learning React library on Udemy, Codecademy and online tutorials.
I am very excited and happy to share my very first "Hello Weather" app using React with an API, fetching city's current weather data (Open Weather Map). I am mostly using props components, state management and event handling. I can't wait to learn more and create more web apps with React! Have a nice weather ! ;)

## Link to the app

You can find the live web app [here](https://luluvann.github.io/react-weather-app/website/) !

## Main features

* Convert temperature Celsius-Farenheit
* Run the city weather search on key press (enter) (besides the search button in the search bar)
* Bookmark the url of favorite city(ies) in the web browser (dynamic url params)


## Run the app in the development mode

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in the browser.
