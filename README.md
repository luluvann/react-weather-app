This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

As a developer-to-be and with basic knowledge of Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript, I decided to go on a 2-month journey this summer learning React library on Udemy, Codecademy and online tutorials.
I am very excited and happy to share my very first "Hello Weather" app using React with an API, fetching city's current weather data (Open Weather Map). I am mostly using props components, state management and event handling. I can't wait to learn more and create more web apps with React!

## Run the app in the development mode

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
